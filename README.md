# 3C7---DSD-
Digital Systems Design using Verilog

This repo corresponds with a third year module on Digital Systems Design, involving the use of the Xilinx Basys3 board and Verilog to <br />
design a number of different systems. <br />

**Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** <br />
A project which when uploaded to the Basys board, functions as a system for performing multiple simple mathematical calculations. <br />
It employs multiple different modules such as a ripple adder, XOR operator, and greater-than-or equal to functionality among others. <br />
When configured using the appropriate XDC file, binary numbers can be input using switches and operated on. <br />

**Stopwatch** <br />
This system utilises the 7-segment display on the Basys board to operate as a stopwatch would. It involves exploring the behaviour of hardware clocks<br />
and their modification to work in appropriate time. <br />

**Assignment 2 / LFSR - Linear Shift Feedback Register** <br />
A module that uses a XOR mask operation to generate a random bit stream.  This is was then used in conjunction with a sequence detection module <br />
to create the functionality coded in Assignment 2. When configured with the XDC file, a binary number can be input using the switches, and <br /> 
a detection count will be displayed on the 7-segment display. <br />
